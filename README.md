# Flappy-Bird-Game
Introduction
This project is a simple implementation of the popular Flappy Bird game using Python and the Pygame library. The game features a bird that the player can control using spacebar or the up arrow key. The objective is to navigate the bird through the gaps between pipes without colliding with them or the ground.

Gameplay
Press the spacebar or the up arrow key to make the bird flap its wings and gain altitude.
Avoid colliding with the pipes and the ground. Collisions result in game over.
Your score increases as you successfully navigate the bird through the pipes.
